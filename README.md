# OurCompany
In this repo we have all Thetta-company-related tasks, talks and discussions.

Please see Github's **issues** section. Feel free to open new issues and ask questions.

## Our Culture

- We are **open source only**.
- We are a **fully distributed** company â€“ we don't care where you are located. However, out core-team is located in Moscow, Russia.
- We have almost no bureaucracy.
- We are a technology company.

 ## Technologies/Languages we use
 
 - Our main goal is to build a community around our product. We use **LiveScript** (CoffeeScript with a bit of functional programming) because this statistics of languages usage confirms that it is widely used in the community currently (as of Nov, 2017):
 
1) javascript - 900K repos
2) coffeescript - 26K repos
3) typescript - 5K repos
4) livescript - 0.6K repos
