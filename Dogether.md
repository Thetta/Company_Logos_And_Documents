The [Liquid Token Distibution approach](https://medium.com/thetta/thettas-liquid-token-generation-event-ltge-988e29425d34) described first by Thetta is so cool that other guys are copying us!

So we got the first proof that our idea is great! Not a single response, but people copying us.
These guys from Dogezer published our idea (of course, not mentioning us; but saying it is as their own approach) in their article dated February 11th (two days after we published the idea on Facebook) — https://medium.com/@dogezercom/daico-and-iterative-investments-by-dogezer-3c35a66fdc3
Also, they have BTT discussion and it is dated February 12th. They have a bunch of Russian devs that can read my Russian description of no-ICO approach:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2100916.msg30118846#msg30118846

There are no problems with this, Thetta is 100% open source. But open source means you have to give links to the original idea and not claim it is “invented by us”. Anyway, we have proof that Thetta “invented” this two days before the guys from Dogezer.
p.s. Funny thing is that they probably won’t use this approach for their own project. This is just a “marketing” article to get more visitors. 
Quote: ”We would like to propose a different approach to solve the same set of problems".
Yes, Thetta invented this approach))

## Proof#1 that Thetta was first
I first published this message to my Facebook on 9th of February, 2018 here -
The link to this discussion (9th of February, 2018) — https://www.facebook.com/delaemkrasivo/posts/10208446114348704?comment_id=10208450664702460&notif_id=1518174185292288&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif
AutoTranslated from Russian:

```
“Yes, that’s just wrote an article about different approaches - https: //medium.com/…/ designing-the-fair-token …
We have such an approach in the project https://web.thetta.io:
1) Do not do any ICO
2) We issue a token starting from the first day of the official release of the project. An investor can sell a token starting on the 1st day.
How do we do this?
1) We have a contract1 that controls the gradual release of tokens for Mailstones + Vegas for the team + bounty items (for which anyone can get tokens), etc. This allows you to give “a little token” to people who actually contribute to the development of the project
2) In the contract2 (Bancor smart token), we shove X our ethers + N tokens to create a market maker.
3) If developers / funders / investors need ETH — they go to contract2 and sell their tokens, lowering their price.
If the public needs the project tokens — they go to the contract2 as a stock exchange and buy the project tokens, raising their price.
4) It is always possible after a year or two or three at the request of DAO to launch ICO (but there is still no desire, and it is unlikely to be)
The results of such a simple scheme:
1) Tokens are very small and they are produced long and gradually.
2) Investor == team member. ANYONE has the opportunity to either sell tokens IMMEDIATELY (do not wait for listing on the stock exchange or end the ICO)), or keep and wait for growth.
3) There is a real goal to raise the price of tokens by their actions developing the project.
4) Save money on listings / launch of ICO and concentrate only on the development of the project.
5) Simplify all finances. No need to account for ETH;
We have a full open source, everything is transparent.
Follow our blog, welcome to the team, etc.) You still have the opportunity to become a member of the core team.
p.s. Subscribe to the blog, we’ll tell you everything gradually. And about the roadmap, and about this scheme”.
```

## Proof#2 that Thetta was first
Here is the commit to our WebSite’s github (9th of February, 2018) https://github.com/Thetta/WebSite1/commit/6b0054333cfab599074bfe850f26c3c3c912bb6e

Quotes:

1. [“No, we don’t plan to do an ICO.”](https://github.com/Thetta/WebSite1/blob/master/project/thetta_token.html#L120)

1. [“Every token holder has the same rights and can sell their tokens at any moment starting from the day 1”](https://github.com/Thetta/WebSite1/blob/master/project/thetta_token.html#L114)

**Again, no problem with these guys. This just means that our Approach is very good. It took 2 days to copy us.**
